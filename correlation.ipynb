These preferences would be small when the individual indicated that they did not like any of the music or movie categories to higher meaning the individual likes a wide variety of movie or music categories.\n","\n"," To visualize two continuous attributes together, a scatterplot is often used. In this figures, a dot is placed at the intersection of the two attributes to depict where this data point shows up on the two attributes.

One issue with data created from scales, is that only whole number can be shown. In these cases, adding some random error to the points can help spread them out. It can also be helpful to add a line of best fit. In the figure below, the data have been jittered to spread them out slightly in a random pattern, and secondly two lines were added. One is in a lighter blue color, represents a line that can be flexible to mimic any association, both linear and non-linear. The second line is forced to be linear. The linear line is what the correlation we will explore later will assume the relationship is. If the two lines are similar, this can indicate that the correlation is a good measure of association between the two attributes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["gf_jitter(overall_music ~ overall_movie, data = preference_data) %>%\n","  gf_smooth(method = 'gam') %>%\n","  gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'darkblue') %>%\n","  gf_labs(x = \"Movie Preferences Scale\", \n","                 y = \"Music Preferences Scales\")\n",""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n"," ## Interpreting the scatterplot\n","\n"," Notice in the scatterplot above that the line is slightly pitched and movie slightly from the lower left part of the figure and increasing slightly to the upper right. This is indicative of a positive relationship, meaning that as one attribute (ie., movie preferences) increases, that means the other attribute (i.e., music preferences) also tends to increase.\n","\n"," # Correlation Basics\n","\n"," Correlations are a standardized descriptive statistic that estimates the degree of association between two attributes. The most commonly used correlation is one that assumes the association is linear. Secondly, since the correlation is standardized, the theoretical range for the correlation always ranges between -1 to +1.\n"," \n","\n"," + -1 = Perfect negative association\n"," + 0 = No association\n"," + +1 = Perfect positive association\n","\n","\n"," Correlations of 0 indicate that knowing something about one attribute does not give us any information about the second attribute. Conversely, having a perfect positive or negative correlation means that knowing the value of one attribute will perfectly tell us the value of the second attribute. An example of this would be the relationship between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales, once we know the temperature there is a perfect formulaic way to convert to the other metric. In real world data, perfect correlations are not found.\n","\n","\n"," ## Computing a Correlation\n","\n"," Below is the formula to compute the sample correlation.\n","\n"," $$ r = \\frac{\\sum (x - \\bar{x})(y - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum [(x - \\bar{x})^2(y - \\bar{y})^2]}} $$\n","\n"," The formula can be broken down into 2 pieces, the numerator represents the covariance and the denominator is the standardization which are the standard deviation of the two attributes.\n"," \n","\n"," ## Computing the correlation in R"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["cor(overall_music ~ overall_movie, data = preference_data, use = \"complete\")\n",""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" This correlation of 0.34 shows that the relationship is positive (greater than 0), but is small to moderate in size. This means that although there is a positive relationship, the relationship is not perfect. Looking back at the scatterplot, if we know the movie or music preference of an individual, it gives information about the other attribute, but not perfectly, there is still error involved.\n","\n"," ## Correlation is not Causation\n","\n"," Lastly, even though there is evidence of a positive correlation, note that this is only an association. We can not say that those with higher movie preferences caused higher music preferences. We can only state that these are related and that this relationship may only be relevant for the sample data we have here. In order for statements about causality to be made, specific characteristics in how the data were collected would need to be established. In general, causal statements are reserved for those in which the data were collected from a randomized experiment which randomly identified who would get a treatment.
